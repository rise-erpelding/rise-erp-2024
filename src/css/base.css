/*
 *  Introduction
 *  Welcome to the CSS file! This is subjectively the most exciting code
 *  of the website. Here we bring together the visual style of the website.
 *
 *  Our CSS is organized using Harry Roberts' (csswizardry.com) Inverted
 *  Triangle CSS (ITCSS) organizational approach. This method is mixed with
 *  Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention for class names throughout
 *  the stylesheet.
 *
 *  Table of Contents:
 *  1. Settings
 *  2. Tools (N/A in plain CSS)
 *  3. Generic (N/A - no reset/normalize needed)
 *  4. Elements
 *  5. Objects (N/A - no objects defined)
 *  6. Components
 *  7. Vendors
 *  8. Utilities

/* Define layer order for ITCSS cascade */
@layer settings, elements, components, utilities;

/* =====================================================================
 * 1. Settings
 *    Global CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, breakpoints).
 *    No selectors generated - just variable definitions.
 */
@import "./settings.css" layer(settings);

/* =====================================================================
 * 2. Tools
 *    In Sass, this contained mixins and functions.
 *    In plain CSS, mixins don't exist - styles are inlined where needed.
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 3. Generic
 *    Reset/Normalize styles. Currently empty.
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 4. Elements
 *    Styling for bare HTML elements (like body, html).
 *    Default browser styles redefined here.
 */
@import "./elements.css" layer(elements);

/* =====================================================================
 * 5. Objects
 *    Class-based selectors for undecorated design patterns.
 *    Currently empty.
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 6. Components
 *    Specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place
 *    and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.
 */
@import "./components-body.css" layer(components);
@import "./components-left.css" layer(components);
@import "./components-right.css" layer(components);

/* =====================================================================
 * 7. Vendors
 *    Third party styles would go here, below Components but above Utilities.
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 8. Utilities
 *    Utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything
 *    which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class.

@import "./utilities.css" layer(utilities);
