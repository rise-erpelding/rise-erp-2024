# Hello!

Welcome to the most recent (as of 2024) version of my personal website and portfolio. In this version, I'm striving to keep the styles and colors similar to the [last iteration](https://github.com/rise-erpelding/portfolio-2020) but am keeping the technology more pared down and taking a [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) approach to building the page, so that I can showcase what matters the most for this project--the information I'm conveying about myself.

This project is built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to handle file bundling. To run this on your machine:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start parcel
